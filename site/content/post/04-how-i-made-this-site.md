I will not lie - I come from a background of dynamic site gen. Somehow, the Static Site Generator craze seems to have missed me until recently (I'm SO EXCITED about what I've discovered here in terms of future projects!). Which is a long-winded way to say that I came into building this site a little blind. That said, after a bit of research, I settled on [Hugo](//gohugo.io/) as the correct choice for me. I did this for two reasons. One, it seems to be gaining in popularity quickly (which tends to be great for support!), and secondly, I have always wanted to play with Go, and have never had an excuse to before (didn't end up having to as it turned out).

The biggest challenge I faced in building this site was simply understanding the massive paradigm shift that is occuring around me. Even with guides, wrapping my head around what the right workflow was for Hugo was challenging for some reason. That said, it was solved the way all ignorance is: Google. I spent most of my free moments today in study, and I think I've got a decent handle on things now, and the next SSG tool I play with will likely go much quicker with this knowlege in hand.
