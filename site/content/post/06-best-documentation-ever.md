First off, the title MAY be a misnomer - it's more like the best documentation I've been exposed to. But that didn't sound as good. Anyway...

As someone who often stuffs things into [Wolfram Alpha](//www.wolframalpha.com) (sometimes just to see what can come out), I find myself referencing the [Wolfram](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/) docs. I don't generally do anything too crazy with it, but for the times that I can't figure out why my input isn't working (or what input should I be using), it's been a great help.

As to *why* I think it's nicely done, it's because I don't "notice it". It doesn't get in the way, in other words. It's very easy to narrow in on what I'm looking for (generally), and performs well to boot. Oh! The use of color on the tiles as a way to segment topic is a nice touch too. :)
