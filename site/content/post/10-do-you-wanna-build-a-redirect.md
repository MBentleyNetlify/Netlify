Wow, this actually was a really fun final problem. Not sure if my solution was the intended one, but I think it should be at the very least approved methodology. :) I am LOVING the flexablity of the _redirects file. There are SO many ways to play with this!

However, to not pen another essay, I'll get right to the task given: 

## (optional/bonus) Can you set up a redirect from “/netlify/anything” to https://www.google.com/search?q=anything ?

I give you: 

https://hire-marvin.bentleyfamily.us/netlify/anything

https://hire-marvin.bentleyfamily.us/netlify/everything

https://hire-marvin.bentleyfamily.us/netlify/and+all+the+things+in+between

Oh, and check out my band (or not, but can I have credit for it working? :D):

## In closing...
Thank you very much for the assignment - this was great experience! I excited to speak with you further!
