This is actually one of the more interesting tests I've dealt with while job searching, so I'm not sure if I could pinpoint anything wrong with it. I guess, my one and only gripe, is I kind of wish it came after the interviews (so that, should something go wrong there, I wouldn't be spending the time to make the site). That said, I ***completely*** understand why it came first (or at least one of the reasons), and I don't blame you for it - I'm sure people passing and failing the test save you from a LOT of wasted interview time.

I also had no complaints about the job posting - it seemed to be pretty clear to me, and gave me a good reason to get in touch with you folks. ;)
