The short answer is: "I like it!"

The ability to deploy DIRECTLY from a git repo is CRAZY to me (I come from a background of WordPress, Drupal, etc.), with builds coming as I perform commits. I don't mean to sound like a barbarian, but seeing it pop to life upon syncing to the master was almost like magic to me. At the very least, whether you hire me or not, I'll be back to take advantage of that sweet free CDN-based hosting. :)

I didn't bother to run benchmarks - I'll take your [CEO's word for it](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/#dynamic-websites-and-caching) that it's stupid fast.
