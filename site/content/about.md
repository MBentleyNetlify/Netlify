This generally entails taking customer supplied address information, &ldquo;cleaning&rdquo; it up using cutting edge postal software (BCC&rsquo;s Mail Manager), and then sorting it to achieve the highest possible postal discount and mailing speed. In addition to this rigorous process, there is also removal of duplicate records, various required databases to run the data against, as well as complex multi-page variable data mail merges. The mail merges are designed and processed using Microsoft Word for simple tasks. For more complicated merges I rely on DesignStream which is a plugin for Adobe Indesign. On some lucky occasions I am asked to go help general production team with envelope stuffing or address inkjetting, which is a nice change of pace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">My time in working on IT projects generally consists of hardware/software research and procurement, consulting with the company Owner/President regarding technology and information security, and dealing with the day-to-day computer issues that arise when supporting people with a wide array of computer experience (everyone from novices to power-users). On the rare occasion that a problem arose that I was unable to solve (or solving it would entail too much risk), I made connections with several professionals in the area to work with to fix the issue.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Some of my IT &amp;

The most notable of which is the Shift Leader Log which I developed. I had extensive training in both human resources and consumer relations. To better facilitate top down communication, I founded a company-wide newsletter and prototyped an internal blog. I was trained to dynamically respond to problems as they arose, and I was given the authority and the means to solve them. I spent a number of months running the night crew of various &ldquo;problem&rdquo; stores, and was able to measure marked improvements in the metrics for each. I was entrusted with a tech support position within the company, and was often the first line of defense in the resolution of various hardware and software issues. Further, I was called upon in a small handful of situations to handle cash theft related problems.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><h5 class="c3" id="h.2z555tgj7d66"><span class="c6">06/13/2000 &ndash; 01/15/2005&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bromley Mountain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peru, VT<br>Lift Operator/Thrill Zone Operator</span></h5><p class="c1"><span class="c10">I was in charge of operating the various rides during the summer, and of getting customers on and off the ski lifts during the winter. I also spent several days a week in the office selling tickets and guest passes.

We sold both walk-in and delivery pizza out of our home Friday nights and also sold wholesale frozen pizzas to a number of stores in the area. I learned a lot about procuring supplies and negotiation to get the best wholesale price. It was also a good lesson in working long hours, as it happened after any day job I had (including high school).</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><h5 class="c3" id="h.h0spr9shhal7"><span class="c6">Fall of 2001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leland and Gray Union High School&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Townshend, VT<br>Substitute Teacher</span></h5><p class="c1"><span class="c4">I was contracted to work as a substitute teacher at Leland and Gray. I was asked to stand in for my former music teacher Ron Kelley for more than a month while he was on the Journey East project. My short time there consisted of setting the short term choral selections that we worked on, as well as teaching the chorus classes. I also assisted Matt Martyn with teaching music theory.</span></p><h2 class="c9" id="h.fefh17mjl3bu"><span class="c11">Education</span></h2><p class="c1"><span>I attended Westwood College and partially completed coursework towards a bachelor&#39;s in Network Administration. </span><span class="c4">I graduated from Leland and Gray Union High School.</span></p><h2 class="c9" id="h.3gzwwmqa35q7"><span class="c11">Interests</span></h2><p class="c1 c19"><span>I enjoy tinkering with computer game programming and playing computer games in general, and have actually run and administered my own Minecraft server for fun (and will again). I love to cook, and consider my best dish to be the Pizza recipe that my father and I developed. While I haven&rsquo;t had the time in years, I very much enjoyed my time as a music composer, having written several songs and scored 2 staged plays. I am lucky enough to be in the band &ldquo;Bad to be Good&rdquo; as the bass player/backup vocalist (www.badtobegood.com).</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1 c19"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 720.00px; height: 1043.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 720.00px; height: 1043.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c19"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 720.00px; height: 502.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 720.00px; height: 502.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 720.00px; height: 432.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 720.00px; height: 432.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c19"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 720.00px; height: 798.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 720.00px; height: 798.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><div><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p></div>
