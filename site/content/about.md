Work Experience

03/12/2007 – 4/21/2017		Five Maples/Mailrite (802-387-5157)	Putney, VT
IT Systems Administrator, Information Security Coordinator and Data Processor


I have been with the Five Maples company (formally Mailrite, Inc.) for more than half of my adult life, and I feel that I have accomplished much there.
My day-to-day data processing work consists of handling address databases. This generally entails taking customer supplied address information, “cleaning” it up using cutting edge postal software (BCC’s Mail Manager), and then sorting it to achieve the highest possible postal discount and mailing speed. In addition to this rigorous process, there is also removal of duplicate records, various required databases to run the data against, as well as complex multi-page variable data mail merges. The mail merges are designed and processed using Microsoft Word for simple tasks. For more complicated merges I rely on DesignStream which is a plugin for Adobe Indesign. On some lucky occasions I am asked to go help general production team with envelope stuffing or address inkjetting, which is a nice change of pace.
My time in working on IT projects generally consists of hardware/software research and procurement, consulting with the company Owner/President regarding technology and information security, and dealing with the day-to-day computer issues that arise when supporting people with a wide array of computer experience (everyone from novices to power-users). On the rare occasion that a problem arose that I was unable to solve (or solving it would entail too much risk), I made connections with several professionals in the area to work with to fix the issue.

Some of my IT & Security highlights are as follows:

2007
Rebuilt from scratch an updated edition of the company website within first month of employment.
2008	
Spearheaded transition process (including research, software compatibility and training) from local Exchange server for email to cloud hosted GSuite (formerly Google Apps). 
2009
Initialized modernizing data backup solution by moving to CrashPlan for encrypted offsite backups. 
2010
Transitioned to a Fully redundant on and off-site backup system (Datto server) to backup virtual images of our two servers that could be loaded in minutes in the event of a failure
Implemented full disk images (via Macrium Reflect) for our clients stored redundantly on an on-site Drobo storage unit.
Ensured all data is encrypted and backed up offsite to several geo-redundant data centers.
Researched and was subsequently directed to implement full disk encryption on all of our computers for security purposes using TrueCrypt.
2012
Researched and set up encrypted data exchange channels for sending and receiving client files, part of an ongoing effort to ensure compliance with various health & financial private information laws (facilitating ongoing business with banks, hospitals, and various other organizations which handled sensitive data).
Lobbied for and was greenlit to procure, install, and configure a 4G LTE automatic fail-over backup Internet provider.
2013
Continued to oversee management of website until we hired a full time web designer in ‘13.
Still in charge of general admin of domain, and several other domains that are not in active use.
Promoted to Information Security Coordinator, which entailed bi-weekly meetings with the Operations Manager and the company Owner/President on status of security related projects, and any recent data-security concerns.
2014
Formulated and performed inaugural and subsequent yearly data security audits, which required ratification from the company owner/President and the Operations Manager.
Organized and lead inaugural company-wide data security training seminar (incorporating a signed employee acknowledgement and accountability form), and subsequent annual events thereafter.
Same data security training is also provided to all new employees shortly after time of hire.
Implemented thumb-print based biometric security for our server room.
2015
Responded to emergency need for defective time-punch system, and adopted a new cost effective biometric time-keeping system for entire hourly staff at a significant savings over the previous unit.
Facilitated our remote employee program. This consisted of a full conference room Teleconferencing setup, new employee hardware, remote desktop procedures and policies, new firewall procurement and setup, traffic shaping implementation, fault tolerant load balancing DSL lines (one primarily dedicated to remote employee while waiting for Fiber), as well as ongoing remote training and support.
Provided daily phone and remote desktop support during an extended absence from work (due to injury).
2016
Oversaw a transition from DSL to high speed fiber Internet access, as well as switching from a decades old on-site PBX to one hosted in the cloud.
Finally, I am also in charge of preliminary scheduling. Each morning, it is up to me to make the decision of which jobs take the highest data processing priority. This is very important, as it sets the pace for the rest of the day throughout the production line.

01/29/2005 – 12/02/2006		Dunkin’ Donuts	Keene, Swanzey and Hinsdale, NH
Night Shift Assistant General Manager	  		                       and Brattleboro, VT
I directed the upgrade of our communications infrastructure between our 10 stores and additional bakery and trained our personnel on how to use it. We also instituted a number of new procedural forms. The most notable of which is the Shift Leader Log which I developed. I had extensive training in both human resources and consumer relations. To better facilitate top down communication, I founded a company-wide newsletter and prototyped an internal blog. I was trained to dynamically respond to problems as they arose, and I was given the authority and the means to solve them. I spent a number of months running the night crew of various “problem” stores, and was able to measure marked improvements in the metrics for each. I was entrusted with a tech support position within the company, and was often the first line of defense in the resolution of various hardware and software issues. Further, I was called upon in a small handful of situations to handle cash theft related problems.

06/13/2000 – 01/15/2005		Bromley Mountain	Peru, VT
Lift Operator/Thrill Zone Operator
I was in charge of operating the various rides during the summer, and of getting customers on and off the ski lifts during the winter. I also spent several days a week in the office selling tickets and guest passes. Having a $10,000 drawer wasn’t uncommon for me at the end of the day, and my count was always correct.

01/13/1997 – 05/23/2005		            The Hearty Entree Pizza					Wardsboro, VT
Co-Owner
During my teenage years, my father and I started a pizza place together. We sold both walk-in and delivery pizza out of our home Friday nights and also sold wholesale frozen pizzas to a number of stores in the area. I learned a lot about procuring supplies and negotiation to get the best wholesale price. It was also a good lesson in working long hours, as it happened after any day job I had (including high school).

Fall of 2001		 Leland and Gray Union High School			           Townshend, VT
Substitute Teacher
I was contracted to work as a substitute teacher at Leland and Gray. I was asked to stand in for my former music teacher Ron Kelley for more than a month while he was on the Journey East project. My short time there consisted of setting the short term choral selections that we worked on, as well as teaching the chorus classes. I also assisted Matt Martyn with teaching music theory.
Education
I attended Westwood College and partially completed coursework towards a bachelor's in Network Administration. I graduated from Leland and Gray Union High School.
Interests
I enjoy tinkering with computer game programming and playing computer games in general, and have actually run and administered my own Minecraft server for fun (and will again). I love to cook, and consider my best dish to be the Pizza recipe that my father and I developed. While I haven’t had the time in years, I very much enjoyed my time as a music composer, having written several songs and scored 2 staged plays. I am lucky enough to be in the band “Bad to be Good” as the bass player/backup vocalist (www.badtobegood.com).
